The files are stored based on the section of work viz:

1. EDA : Contains the Exploratory Data Analysis of the two Data Sets

2. LSTM Models : Contains the LSTM model pipeline based on user sessions

3. Tensorboard : Example Code for Tensorboard visualizations

4. User Journey Modeling : End to End Pipeline for modeling USER BEHAVIOR w.r.t INTERACTIONS WITH A GIVEN PRODUCT i.e. from Data Cleaning to Cluster Analysis. Contains file for both datasets.

5. User Session Modeling: End to End Pipeline for modeling USER BEHAVIOR ACROSS ONLINE SESSIONS i.e. from Data Cleaning to Cluster Analysis. Contains file for both datasets.

6. .DS_Store : System File
